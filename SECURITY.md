## Remaining Vulnerabilities

### Cannot Fix Without Breaking Changes

#### 1. connect-multiparty (High Severity)
- **Package**: connect-multiparty
- **Affected Dependency**: hubot@3.5.0
- **Issue**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability
- **Why Not Fixed**: 
  - Upgrading hubot to v9+ (which removes connect-multiparty) breaks compatibility with multiple hubot plugins:
    - hubot-diagnostics (requires hubot ">=2 <10")
    - hubot-help (requires hubot ">=2 <10")
    - hubot-heroku-keepalive (requires hubot ">=2 <10")
    - hubot-maps (requires hubot ">=2 <10")
    - hubot-shipit (requires hubot ">=2 <10")
  - Would require extensive refactoring of tests and initializers
  - The hubot v9+ API has significant breaking changes (CommonJS to ESM)
- **Mitigation**: The slackbot does not expose file upload functionality to users, limiting the attack surface.

#### 2. form-data (Critical Severity)
- **Package**: form-data
- **Affected Dependency**: hubot-slack@4.10.0 → @slack/client@3.16.1 → request (deprecated)
- **Issue**: Uses unsafe random function for choosing boundary
- **Why Not Fixed**:
  - hubot-slack depends on @slack/client@3.16.1
  - @slack/client is deprecated and depends on the deprecated request package
  - There is no updated version of hubot-slack that addresses this
  - Downgrading hubot-slack would introduce more vulnerabilities
- **Risk Assessment**: This is a critical vulnerability that should be monitored closely. The attack requires intercepting multipart form data and predicting boundaries. Consider this a known risk that requires a long-term solution (see Recommendations below).

#### 3. tough-cookie (Moderate Severity)  
- **Package**: tough-cookie
- **Affected Dependency**: hubot-slack@4.10.0 → @slack/client@3.16.1 → request (deprecated)
- **Issue**: Prototype pollution vulnerability
- **Why Not Fixed**: Same dependency chain as form-data above
- **Risk Assessment**: Prototype pollution can lead to security issues if user-controlled data is processed. This is a known risk that should be addressed as part of the long-term migration strategy.

## Recommendations

### Short Term
- Monitor these packages for security updates from maintainers
- Consider the risk acceptable given the mitigation factors

### Long Term
- Consider migrating from hubot to a modern bot framework that doesn't rely on deprecated packages
- Alternatively, contribute to or fork hubot-slack to update its dependencies

## Notes
- The deprecated `request` package is the root cause of several remaining vulnerabilities
- Slack has deprecated @slack/client in favor of @slack/web-api and @slack/rtm-api
- The hubot ecosystem has limited active maintenance
